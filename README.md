# Gurobi Netflow Optimization Project

## Overview

This project addresses a Netflow optimization problem involving the production and transportation of two products (pencils and pens) between two production cities (Detroit and Denver) and three destination cities (Boston, New York, and Seattle). The objective is to optimize the transportation network to meet the quantity demands of the destination cities while respecting the transportation capacity constraints on each route.

## Files

1. **netflow_optimization.ipynb**
   - Jupyter Notebook containing the Gurobi implementation of the Netflow optimization problem.
   
## Problem Statement

The problem involves determining the optimal flow of products through the transportation network to meet the demand in the destination cities while minimizing transportation costs. The transportation capacities on each route must be respected.

## Usage

1. Open the `netflow_optimization.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Execute the notebook cells to run the optimization model and view the results.

## Dependencies

- Gurobi Optimizer: Ensure you have Gurobi installed and set up in your Python environment.

## References

This project is based on the Gurobi academic website's optimization examples.
